The process of stack and queue are different. Stack process in a
Last Come First Served manner, while Queue process in a First
Come First Served manner. Making their ordering different.

As we can observer from in Q2 we saw that the coordinate always
continues from the last node it has visited. This behaves like a
DFS because it only starts processing a next branch untill the
current branch reached a end. Question 4 behave essentially like
a BFS as it explors each branch simutaneously. That's why we can
observe this circular fashion. The numbers on r and c seems to
be more random in Queue than Stack, that is because our maze has
only 4 direction perpendicular to each other. Hence when moving
in a DFS fashion (in this case, refering to Stack), it is common
that they continue in a straight line. While in a BFS fashion 
(Queue), once it knows a branch is not blocked, in moves on to
the next branch before.
